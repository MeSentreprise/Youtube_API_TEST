**Hi**
I'm Creating a automation project: it's a robot that upload a video you automatically when you say it like J.A.R.V.I.S

# Master => The Project
# Test => The First API Test

**1. Libs**:
Libs are created from me, Google.py and Upload.py are here just to simplify my code. Upload.py have a function that can upload a video on youtube: *Upload_Video(title,description,selfdeclaredforkids)*
